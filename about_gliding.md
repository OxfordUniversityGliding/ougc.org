## How do we fly?
Gliders are aircraft without engines. They work by getting an initial launch, either towed up behind a powered aircraft, or by taking a winch launch. Once released they descend at a constant rate. To remain airborne the pilot must find sources of lift in the atmosphere. Once lift has been found the pilot stays in it, rising upwards with the air-mass. Once at a suitable altitude you can fly on, descending until it is time to find lift again. By doing this a glider can travel vast distances (thousands of kilometres) in a day, all without an engine!

Glider flying can be whatever you make it - scenic local soaring, long cross country flying, high paced aerobatics, low level ridge-running, high altitude flight in wave, formation flight, instructing, vintage aircraft and much more.

    <p class="feature-description">
      A winch (about a mile off to the left in the picture) takes in a cable attached to the glider, pulling it forwards and providing airspeed. Once the glider is nearly over the winch the cable is released from the glider.

    <p class="feature-description">
      Thermal lift is found when a column of air that is warmer than the surrounding airmass rises. Gliders tightly circle in these thermals, rising with the air.

    <p class="feature-description">
      Ridge lift is found when wind blows across a ridge, and is forced upward by the topography (right to left in pic). Gliders can fly straight along the upwind edge of the ridge, rising with the air.

    <p class="feature-description">
      In mountainous regions wind that is forced to rise by mountains can, under the right conditions, create atmospheric ‘waves’ that ‘bounce’ in the atmosphere. By flying in the up-going bars of lift gliders regularly reach over 10 000ft, often flying as high as airliners.

## How gliding at Oxford works
OUGC’s home airfield is RAF Weston-on-the-Green, a few miles north of Oxford. Weston is also home to our ‘parent’ club, the [Oxford Gliding Club](https://www.oxfordgliding.com/) (OGC). By being a member of OUGC you are automatically also made a member of OGC, with access to their full fleet of club aircraft and instructing team. Here you join a unique club, where you can go from complete beginner to solo pilot in less than a year, learn aerobatics, experience a great atmosphere and fly across the country.

    “One of my best memories at Oxford will be climbing in a thermal over Oxford, 
    with a Red Kite flying off my right wing, turning together as we soar towards the clouds. 
    To think of the beauty my classmates, thousands of feet below, were missing!”
