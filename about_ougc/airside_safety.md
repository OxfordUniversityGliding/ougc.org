# Safety & Risk Assessment
{: .about-events-titles}

Oxford University Gliding Club operates under several layers of oversight, each designed to minimise risk in the sport. 
{: .about-all-intros}
All operations occur according to British Gliding Association guidelines. Our aircraft are maintained to BGA standard, with daily inspections before every flight and a full annual carried out by our licensed inspection team. We are also fully insured by Crispin Speers Aviation Insurance.
{: .about-all-intros}
Home flying operations are based at RAF Weston-on-the-Green with Oxford Gliding Club (our host club), and as such are carried out under their rules, regulations and oversight system. More details can be found on their website, [Oxford Gliding Club](https://www.oxfordgliding.com/ "Oxford Gliding Club").
