<title>The 1937 Club - OUGC</title>

# Introducing ‘The 1937 Club’
{: .about-alumni-titles}

The 1937 Club offers membership to all alumni of OUGC and kind donors. It aims to reconnect the OUGC alumni with other alumni, friends, and the current members. This will help to support OUGC financially, supporting us in our current campaign to re-gel our gliders and purchase them new trailers. The club also aims to better integrate the community of past and present OUGC members and support a thriving gliding community.

Given the diverse structure of the club our alumni find themselves in a variety of different circumstances after leaving university. As such, the club welcomes donations of any amounts and any donor automatically becomes a member of The 1937 Club, receiving E news and an invite to our annual dinner.

Our main aim is to raise funds for the re-finishing of the gel coat on our K-21 G-DESB. We are about £10,000 short of our target and we would appreciate help in any form. In addition to financing, this may include volunteering your time to help with preventative maintenance, organising logistics for transporting the glider and trailer, etc.
