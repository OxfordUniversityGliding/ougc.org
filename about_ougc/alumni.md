# Introducing ‘The 1937 Club’
{: .about-alumni-titles}

The 1937 Club offers membership to all alumni of OUGC. It aims to reconnect the OUGC alumni with other alumni, friends, and the current members. This will help to support OUGC financially, supporting us in our current campaign to re-gel our gliders and purchase them new trailers. The club also aims to better integrate the community of past and present OUGC members and support a thriving gliding community.
