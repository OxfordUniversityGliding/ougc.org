As pilots progress through gliding, they may achieve different badges and qualifications from the British Gliding Association (solo, Bronze, Cross Country [XC], Aerobatics, Distance Diplomas, Instructor Ratings) and Fédération Aéronautique Internationale (Silver, Gold, Diamond recognising different levels of height, distance, and flight duration). 

OUGC also has an annual awards night as part of the annual dinner. Each year, a student new to the club is awarded the ‘Outstanding Progress’ award.

The first major milestone is **GOING SOLO** - each year OUGC students reach this goal, often doing their first solo flight in our very own glider ESB - it is a fantastic feeling as you can see from the photos below.
