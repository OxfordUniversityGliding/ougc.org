<br>
  We fly gliders &mdash aeroplanes without engines. Gliding is a beautiful, pure form of flight that harnesses the natural energy in the atmosphere. Launched into the sky at 70 mph, you will find it can be dramatic, challenging and exciting. On a good flying day, you could be soaring with the birds and among the clouds. 

<br>
<br>
  Since 1937 OUGCâ€™s mission has been to expand the sport of Gliding at Oxford. All students and staff at Oxford and Oxford Brookes Universities are eligible for membership. Everyone is welcome, from absolute beginners to experienced pilots.
