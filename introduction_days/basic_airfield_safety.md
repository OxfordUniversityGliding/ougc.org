# Basic Airfield Safety

**A good day’s flying is a safe day’s flying.**

Club safety at Oxford GC/OUGC includes not only safety whilst flying gliders, but also being aware of some potential hazards on the ground. The points below are intended to give some guidance about safety in the hangar and on the airfield.  

One of the most important things to remember is: **there are no stupid questions on the airfield**. If you have any questions, if you are unsure about something, or if you have been asked to do something you don’t know how to do, always ask - don’t assume. **On your first day at the airfield, you won’t be expected to help independently.**   

**Don’t fly if you have drunk alcohol the night before.** The coordination needed for flying is harder than that required to drive a car – so be sensible and only fly if you are fit to do so!

## In the hangar 
- Care must be taken when walking in the hangar. Do not step over the wings or fuselage of a glider – always walk around.  

- The hangar doors are heavy. Only manoeuvre them if you have been shown what to do.  

## Handling gliders and equipment
- Take care when manoeuvring gliders. Everyone helps out with pushing gliders on the airfield and in the hangar, but don’t do so unsupervised unless you have been shown what to do. Except in special circumstances, only one wingtip is held at one time and this must be the upwind tip. **Do not push on the canopy (clear window) of the glider ever. You will be shown the areas of the glider it is OK to push on.**

- Never put parachutes on the ground, either in the hangar or outside. A damp or damaged parachute may not deploy. All efforts should be made to keep parachutes out of the rain. If you are asked to get a parachute for a glider at the start of a day’s flying, ask someone to show you how to check the parachute is ready for use.

- Glider canopies should be left down and locked or open and supervised. If it is at all windy, canopies should be held when open to prevent a gust of wind from ripping them off. 

- Don’t put your hand through the direct vision panel for any other reason than to open the canopy latch.  (ie if you want to pull the cable release knob on the ground, open the canopy rather than reaching through!)

## On the airfield
- When crossing the airfield either on foot or in a car, make sure you keep a good lookout for gliders approaching at all times. **Check with the Duty Pilot or Duty Instructor before moving around the airfield!** You will not hear gliders until it is too late! **If you see a glider heading towards you, stop where you are – the pilot will then be able to fly around you.**  Remember that in general the whole airfield is active, and is available for landing.

- **Stay near the launch point with other people.** Until you are used to the airfield, you may not be fully aware of all the possible dangers on the airfield such as cables, aircraft and vehicles. People are happy to give you a lift if you need the toilet or something!

- **Stand well clear of the cables at all times** unless you have been asked to move one, or are launching a glider, as they move at high speeds without warning. Often, we operate with two cables. **Never hold onto a cable whilst a launch is taking place on the other cable.**  

- Do not attempt to launch a glider until you have been shown how to do so. This is something you can ask to learn how to do after you have had ~10 flights, at the discretion of the Duty Instructor.

- People attending an introduction day are NOT permitted to drive either the buggies or retrieve vehicles.

## Cars on the airfield
**If you bring a car, we recommend that you leave it by the hangar.** If you do decide to drive out to the launch point, always drive around the perimeter track (and make sure not to drive in front of the winch!). Keep a good lookout as you drive around for gliders approaching, especially when you are nearing the launch point. You may have to stop and wait for a glider to land before driving up to the launch point. Park on the perimeter track. It is very important to leave your keys in the ignition if your car (or motorcycle) is parked at the launch point, so that it can be moved if necessary.  

**Be aware that your insurance will almost certainly not cover you on the airfield.**

*Happy flying!*
