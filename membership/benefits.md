<title>Membership Benefits - OUGC</title>

# MEMBERSHIP BENEFITS
By joining OUGC you become an affiliate member of Oxford Gliding Club at RAF Weston-on-the-Green for one year (starting from the first month that you fly), and enjoy student or full flying fees. As a student you cannot learn to fly any cheaper than this!

OUGC members can fly gliders from both the [OUGC fleet](/about_ougc/aircraft/) and the [Oxford club fleet](https://www.oxfordgliding.com/club-fleet). Instruction is free - you will be taught how to fly until you reach solo standard (and after that too). There is a syllabus of flight exercises to work through, but once in a while, everyone enjoys a chill flight just to soak up the view.

You will participate in all aspects of the gliding club, including airfield operations, and aircraft maintenance. No prior experience is required, just a willingness to pitch in, help others, and learn. Driving buggies and using the radios is pretty good fun too!  

Membership entitles you to come on our expeditions and compete in university competitions, run between terms. 

Once qualified, OUGC members can fly the club's Grob Astir, *FEF*, for only Â£0.30 per minute.

Members also enjoy discounted or free entry to our socials throughout the year.

**Unfortunately we are unable to offer membership to students under the age of 18.**
