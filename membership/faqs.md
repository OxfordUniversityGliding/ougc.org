## ONLINE EVENTS & RESOURCES
Unfortunately, Covid has reduced flying opportunities. We have compiled a list of online events and resources in a PDF. Some are educational; some are entertaining; all of them are about GLIDING!  Most of these things are FREE! Last updated: November 2020. [LINK HERE](/assets/images/membership/Gliding%20Virtual%20Events%20Published%202020-11-02.pdf)

## UK Junior gliding team training materials
These materials were shared in a BGA webinar by Jake Brattle and Finn Sleigh held in March 2020. Lots of advanced material available in this Google Drive. [LINK HERE](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1GQf3C_27gMvJtXtnpHWDK5QHs0HTHB11?usp=sharing)
