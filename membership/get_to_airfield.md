</div>
 It takes about an hour. You should wear a helmet and hi-vis clothing, and bring bike lights. **Do not cycle on the A34.**

### Train 
To Bicester Village from Oxford or Oxford Parkway (Chiltern Railways, 15 mins) & taxi/cycle (~25 mins) to the airfield. Return off-peak train ticket is less than £3 with a railcard. On Sundays this will get you to the airfield LATE however.

### Bus 
From Oxford city centre to Kirtlington Park (Diamond Bus route 250) & 35 minute walk to the airfield (Saturdays only). Return ticket £8-ish. You will get to the airfield LATE.

Bus 24 to Weston-on-the-Green village results in a highly dangerous 1 mile walk along the A road with no curb. Not recommended.
