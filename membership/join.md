<title>Joining the Club - OUGC</title>

# How to Join
Membership is open to all students and staff at both Oxford University and Oxford Brookes University. 

**Unfortunately we are unable to offer membership to those under the age of 18.**  

**There is a weight limit of 95kg for pilots under instruction in gliders at our club. **This is purely due to the limitations of the aircraft we fly (max P2 weight 104 kg including parachute).

## New member (zero gliding experience)?
**To join OUGC, initially you will need to join an introduction day.** An ‘Intro Day’ is a taster session of what gliding is all about!

</div>

After your intro day, you will have the option to join a waitlist to upgrade to a year-long membership. By upgrading your membership, you become an affiliate member (if a student) or a full member (if a staff member) of the Oxford Gliding Club.  

**Your membership fee (whether intro day or full year) does not include any [flying fees](/membership/fees/).** You pay as you go depending on how much flying you do.

## New member (previous gliding experience)?

If you have previous experience flying gliders (i.e. flown solo before, or pre-solo with 20+ flights in the past two years), or signifcant other aviation experience (i.e. complete PPL)  we may be able to offer you full year membership. **This is at the discretion of the OUGC committee, so please get in touch with us.** Upon joining OUGC, we will ask you to come along to the airfield when an introduction day is taking place so that we can show you how the gliding club operates, and introduce you to people.

## FULL YEAR MEMBERSHIP? 

**Completed your intro day and want more gliding?** **_After your intro day_** **, you can join a waitlist to upgrade to a full year student or staff membership.**

**Or are you a OUGC member returning for another year of fun and flying?** Welcome back!

Full members are expected to attend the airfield for gliding two full weekend days per calendar month on average. 

We reserve the right not to renew your membership if you do not participate in a minimum of club operations - in gliding, everyone volunteers to help everyone else fly!

**We usually operate a waiting list for new beginner members,** so you should apply to be a member soon after your intro day if you’re keen! However, please note that the waitlist does not operate on a fixed timeline and we cannot guarantee availability of membership slots at any given time.

<div class="home-button-wrapper">
  <a href="https://forms.gle/jCnv3v9Yw5ZaXLJd9" class="big-button">Membership application form</a>
</div>

1. Complete the online membership application form above **only after you’ve completed your intro day.**

2. Our membership secretary will email you to confirm your membership place (or advise that you are on the waiting list). 

3. Our membership secretary will also email you some additional paperwork and payment details. Pay for your membership via bank transfer. 

4. Then the membership secretary will inform you that your membership has been activated.

5. That’s it! The airfield is open every weekend: if you want to fly, make sure you turn up at 8.30am and help to set up! As this is a club everyone volunteers. It is expected everyone helps out on the ground, so when it’s your turn to fly everyone else will help you.
