<title>Kit - OUGC</title>

# OUGC Kit
Gliding doesn’t require any ultra-specialised clothing. In winter, you just need several warm layers, a windproof coat, sturdy waterproof shoes, and sunglasses. On a sunny summer day, wear any shorts/trousers + t-shirt, sunglasses, and who could forget the bucket hat (ultimate gliding chic).

However if you want to look extra stylish on the airfield, consider wearing some official OUGC kit! A range of OUGC merchandise is available to purchase through the official Oxford University online sports store.

We also sell OUGC bucket hats and beanies for £10 each. Ask a committee member when you're at the airfield!

You will also need a logbook, which can be purchased at the airfield for approximately £3.50.

If you have any ideas about merch, i.e. T-shirts, stickers, umbrellas etc, please contact [Teddy](mailto:hong.ong@oriel.ox.ac.uk). As a small club we are limited by our order size but we'll try our best to fulfill your dreams!
