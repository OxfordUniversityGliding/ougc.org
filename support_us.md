# Surface Refinishing for Our K21 Training Glider
We are in a privileged position compared to other university clubs
to own and operate a 2-seater training glider. 
However, a few major mid-life maintenance items are due. 
If all goes to plan, completing the surface refinishing and 9,000 hours inspection will allow us to apply for a life extension from 12,000 to 18,000 hours. This will give the glider another 30 years of flying life, and boost its value to over £100,000.

In its decades of service, a training glider undergoes many stress cycles from simulated launch failures and hard landings. The surface layer has now developed many systematic, parallel cracks. While this may appear cosmetic, it allows undetectable water damage of internal structure to occur, and inspectors will refuse to certify the glider's airworthiness after some point. Sanding off all the surface is the only way to inspect the fibreglass underneath, and is a routine mid-life item for gliders.

In order to send it for this repair, we also need a new trailer in which to transport it. Our old metal tube trailer has succumbed to the weather and suffered irrepairable rust damage. We hope to buy a new, top-of-the-line _Cobra_ trailer made of fibreglass and alumnium which would last many decades due to the nature of its construction.

Overall, for the surface refinishing, 9,000 hours inspection, and new trailer, we are looking to raise **£60,000**. Thanks to the stewardship of past committees, OUGC has some reserves and is financially stable. If we can get past this hurdle, then our assets will be well positioned for decades to come. We are deeply grateful for anyone who can assist us in reaching our goals. Please do not hesitate to get in touch at **president@ougc.org** if you would like to discuss more details.

# Our Generous Donors
Many have helped us on our way, most of whom are inspectors and instructors with their time and expertise. Over the past years we have had several generous supporters, including Paul Jessop and Dean Winslow.
