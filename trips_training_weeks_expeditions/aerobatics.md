    ESB, our K21, is a great aerobatic trainer. At some training weeks there are instructors qualified to teach aerobatics. If youâ€™re close to solo or beyond, you might have the opportunity to learn how to do loops, stall turns, chandelles and much more! Some of our pilots (Bronze +) have even earned their aerobatic badges for exceptional performance.

    These camps are extremely popular - you can read a trip report from 2017 <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JkfuHHIvkd_qq_nqq0qtcwBdDzbauTTD/view?usp=sharing">here</a>.
