## About OUGC Trips

We regularly organise expeditions, competitions and training weeks, held both at other sites and at our home airfield. In essence, they are gliding holidays. A group of us normally stay together at a lodge, bunk room or camp and get LOADS of flying with dedicated instructors, whilst also enjoy other gliding and non-gliding related fun. 

- December or January: winter training week/weekend 

- March or April: spring trip training week

- June: Varsity match against Cambridge either at Gransden Lodge (Cambridge host) or RAF WOTG (Oxford host)

- July: Inter Unis week. An amazing fun training week and competition for all experience levels. A different uni club hosts each year.

For training weeks, Inter Unis and Varsity we try and take our own gliders as well as instructor support. Itâ€™s huge fun. Our host club Oxford GC also invite us on their expeditions. We also run ad hoc trips to other sites. Sometimes we do aerobatics at training weeks. Sometimes we venture to Europe! Forthcoming trips are always advertised in members' newsletters via email.
